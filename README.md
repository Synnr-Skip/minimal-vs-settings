# Minimal Visual Studio Settings
Collection of VS window and command/menu-bar settings I used to configure a minimal environment for Node.js & C# development, as shown in our recent [Connect video](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Visual-Studio/Connect-event-2015/801).
* [Menu bar and command bar settings](mousetraps-menubar-2015-11-20.vssettings): removes a bunch of menu bars and command bars I found unnecessary. It could probably be even more minimal, but this was good enough for me.
* [Window layout settings](mousetraps-windows-2015-11-20.vssettings): positions of solution exporer, task panes, etc.

You can import these settings into VS using `Tools > Import and Export settings`

Additionally I use the following extensions:
* [Hide Main Menu](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/bdbcffca-32a6-4034-8e89-c31b86ad4813)
* [Open Command-Line](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/4e84e2cf-2d6b-472a-b1e2-b84932511379)

Other tips:
* Make use of full-screen mode (`Alt-Shift-Enter`) during development
