# Minimal Visual Studio Settings
Collection of settings I used to configure a minimal environment for Node.js & C# development, as shown in our recent [Connect video](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Visual-Studio/Connect-event-2015/801).

You could certainly make VS even more minimal (VS is *insanely* customizable), but this was good enough for me.

## VS Settings
Right click and select save-as to download (or clone the repo yourself). You can import these settings into VS using `Tools > Import and Export settings`
* [Menu bar and command bar settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mousetraps/minimal-vs-settings/master/mousetraps-menubar-2015-11-20.vssettings): removes a bunch of menu bars and commands I found unnecessary.
* [Window layout settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mousetraps/minimal-vs-settings/master/mousetraps-windows-2015-11-20.vssettings): positions of solution exporer, task panes, etc.

## Extensions
* [Hide Main Menu](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/bdbcffca-32a6-4034-8e89-c31b86ad4813): get rid of the main menu bar to reduce visual clutter.
* [Open Command-Line](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/4e84e2cf-2d6b-472a-b1e2-b84932511379): open command lines *really fast* using `Alt-Space`

## Other tips
* Make use of full-screen mode (`Alt-Shift-Enter`) during development
